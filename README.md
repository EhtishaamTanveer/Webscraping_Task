2. Stock Selection: Extracted data focuses on Tesla (TSLA) and Gamestop (GME).
3. Data Points: Targets specific data points such as date, price, and revenue. 
4. Python Libraries: Utilizes Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping and data parsing.
5. Stock Visualization: Plotting the historical stock data (price and revenue) to understand its pattern over the years.

### Benefits:

2. Customization: The scraping script can be adapted to target different websites and data points.
3. Financial Analysis: Extracted data can be used for financial analysis, trend visualization, and price prediction models. (Optional: Add this if your code facilitates further analysis)
